CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) in express JS

- CORS is a security feature in web browsers that prevents
requests from different origins unless explicitly allowed by
the server.

- Same-origin Policy restricts requests from different origins (
protocol, domain, or port )

- CORS allows servers to specify who can access their
resources.
